For graph1.txt:
We notice that RSAT solver shows that graph1 is unsatisfiable when only 3 colors are used.
However, graph1 is shown to be satisfiable when 4 colors are used.

These two results show us that 3 colors are not sufficient to do the graph collaring correctly. We need at least 4 colors to solve this graph solving problem.

A possible solution: Consider 4 colors c1, c2, c3 and c4.
IF ( c1 = 1,4 and c2= 5,7 and c3 = 6,2 and c4=3) we would solve the graph collaring problem [where 1,2,3..7 are the nodes labels]

For graph2.txt:

Using RSAT solver we see that it is not solvable with 3 colors. We keep testing by increasing the colors by 1 each time.

We now see that the graph2 is solvable with atleast 8 colors.
